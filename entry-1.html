        <p>Hola todos! 

I have made it to Cuba safely and survived the first two days of blistering heat without a sunburn! We have been eating at a lot of Italian/Spanish-influenced restaurants, so the food is pretty good, but not crazy amazing. Meals take FOREVER here, but if you are in a good mood, it’s a nice time to talk and relax. The 20 of us have actually survived and bonded with the lack of phone-usage. Yesterday we visited Old Havana where we saw beautifully colored buildings and old cars, but it was just so hot that it was hard to concentrate on the tour in Spanish. It’s crazy because most people here just assume we only speak English and don’t even give us a chance to practice. 

Yesterday, we went to the Malecón at night, which is the ocean wall, to sit and look at the water. These Cubans in their 20s, who always hang out with Northwestern students on this program, introduced themselves to us and knew we wanted to speak in Spanish. One was pretty easy to understand, but the ringleader sounded like he was not fully opening his mouth. I have found that most Cubans are innocent enough, but they will try to talk to you on the street, stare at Americans, and maybe even try to touch the girls. It’s not threatening though, just very different than in the U.S. I feel very safe here and we can walk around at night in a group of girls with absolutely no problems. 

The place where I am staying, Casa Lilly, has a really pretty view. The air-conditioning situation is not really that great, but it’s better than how most Cubans live, so I am thankful. I am on the 18th floor with 3 other girls. It has a nice view from the balcony, but it is not the nicest floor (13th) where we eat our breakfasts. We start classes next week so we are just exploring Habana during this week. I hope I can find a place or way to work out because the hot outdoors are not the best option…at least the food isn’t too unhealthy! 

I have to get pictures from my phone so I will send a second email with them! 

Adiós!
