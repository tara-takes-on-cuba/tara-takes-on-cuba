        <p>Hola de Habana!
<br><br>
(Warning: this paragraph is about Cuban history, so skip to the next one if you want a quicker, more personal update) Over the last few days, I have learned a lot more about the city and the culture that has grown from communism here. It seems like they love Obama, hate Trump, and don’t really like Fidel either. They can speak out however they choose, but there is propaganda on billboards and very obvious monopolies on goods, such as bottled water. I learned that the Cuban government copied the Russian government in a lot ways, including enforcing architects to build with prefabricated materials that are not necessarily the best in the Cuban climate with the Ministry of Construction. We see a lot of run-down, old-looking buildings because of that, but art and architecture have still managed to grow here. The arts, especially acting now, are very encouraged through the free education system because sending actors to other countries can provide Cuba with a lot of money quickly. This may sound annoyingly educational, but I feel like the American school systems have really ignored Cuban history because of our scarred relations. For that reason, my expectations were hazy coming here, and nothing is really how I could have imagined. Some of our classes here will be held at ISA in west Habana, so if you’re interested in architecture or history, I would recommend looking it up because the school, which was originally designed for the arts, is not only beautiful, but also a symbol of the culture here from the 60s. I have not visited it yet, but we are going on Friday for our first day of “class."
<br><br>
We are starting to be weened off of day-long group activities thankfully, so I have gone out with some girlfriends to eat and explore the nightlife. A large group of Americans attracts so much attention, but Cubans will still come up to you, being their overly-friendly selves no matter what. This is especially because no native carries around giant bottled waters everywhere, but we as Americans cannot digest the natural water here. On the other hand, I love being able to go out for a cheap meal, like down the road for a 50 cent pizza or to a nicer restaurant for croquettes and chicken for just $10. It’s crazy how cheap everything here is, but it is because the average Cuban making $20 a month can survive. Our group seems to have made some Cuban friends already, which is good since we are having a party on Saturday and get to invite them. Last night, we went to a club that has live music every Wednesday and danced. I may have learned some Cuban dance moves, but I also felt like I was being spun around a lot with no idea what was happening. I personally receive a lot of attention and comments because of how white and different I am, which is something I am definitely not accustomed to in my homogeneous life back home. I am off to the museum about the Cuban Revolution AKA the propaganda museum, which should be very interesting. I also hope to venture on public transportation to the beach this weekend (hopefully when it’s cloudy or later in the day).

Hasta luego!<br>
