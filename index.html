        <p>Hola todos! 

I have made it to Cuba safely and survived the first two days of blistering heat without a sunburn! We have been eating at a lot of Italian/Spanish-influenced restaurants, so the food is pretty good, but not crazy amazing. Meals take FOREVER here, but if you are in a good mood, it’s a nice time to talk and relax. The 20 of us have actually survived and bonded with the lack of phone-usage. Yesterday we visited Old Havana where we saw beautifully colored buildings and old cars, but it was just so hot that it was hard to concentrate on the tour in Spanish. It’s crazy because most people here just assume we only speak English and don’t even give us a chance to practice. 

Yesterday, we went to the Malecón at night, which is the ocean wall, to sit and look at the water. These Cubans in their 20s, who always hang out with Northwestern students on this program, introduced themselves to us and knew we wanted to speak in Spanish. One was pretty easy to understand, but the ringleader sounded like he was not fully opening his mouth. I have found that most Cubans are innocent enough, but they will try to talk to you on the street, stare at Americans, and maybe even try to touch the girls. It’s not threatening though, just very different than in the U.S. I feel very safe here and we can walk around at night in a group of girls with absolutely no problems. 

The place where I am staying, Casa Lilly, has a really pretty view. The air-conditioning situation is not really that great, but it’s better than how most Cubans live, so I am thankful. I am on the 18th floor with 3 other girls. It has a nice view from the balcony, but it is not the nicest floor (13th) where we eat our breakfasts. We start classes next week so we are just exploring Habana during this week. I hope I can find a place or way to work out because the hot outdoors are not the best option…at least the food isn’t too unhealthy! 

I have to get pictures from my phone so I will send a second email with them! 

Adiós!

    <p>Hola de Habana!

(Warning: this paragraph is about Cuban history, so skip to the next one if you want a quicker, more personal update) Over the last few days, I have learned a lot more about the city and the culture that has grown from communism here. It seems like they love Obama, hate Trump, and don’t really like Fidel either. They can speak out however they choose, but there is propaganda on billboards and very obvious monopolies on goods, such as bottled water. I learned that the Cuban government copied the Russian government in a lot ways, including enforcing architects to build with prefabricated materials that are not necessarily the best in the Cuban climate with the Ministry of Construction. We see a lot of run-down, old-looking buildings because of that, but art and architecture have still managed to grow here. The arts, especially acting now, are very encouraged through the free education system because sending actors to other countries can provide Cuba with a lot of money quickly. This may sound annoyingly educational, but I feel like the American school systems have really ignored Cuban history because of our scarred relations. For that reason, my expectations were hazy coming here, and nothing is really how I could have imagined. Some of our classes here will be held at ISA in west Habana, so if you’re interested in architecture or history, I would recommend looking it up because the school, which was originally designed for the arts, is not only beautiful, but also a symbol of the culture here from the 60s. I have not visited it yet, but we are going on Friday for our first day of “class."

We are starting to be weened off of day-long group activities thankfully, so I have gone out with some girlfriends to eat and explore the nightlife. A large group of Americans attracts so much attention, but Cubans will still come up to you, being their overly-friendly selves no matter what. This is especially because no native carries around giant bottled waters everywhere, but we as Americans cannot digest the natural water here. On the other hand, I love being able to go out for a cheap meal, like down the road for a 50 cent pizza or to a nicer restaurant for croquettes and chicken for just $10. It’s crazy how cheap everything here is, but it is because the average Cuban making $20 a month can survive. Our group seems to have made some Cuban friends already, which is good since we are having a party on Saturday and get to invite them. Last night, we went to a club that has live music every Wednesday and danced. I may have learned some Cuban dance moves, but I also felt like I was being spun around a lot with no idea what was happening. I personally receive a lot of attention and comments because of how white and different I am, which is something I am definitely not accustomed to in my homogeneous life back home. I am off to the museum about the Cuban Revolution AKA the propaganda museum, which should be very interesting. I also hope to venture on public transportation to the beach this weekend (hopefully when it’s cloudy or later in the day).

Hasta luego!
Tara</p>
